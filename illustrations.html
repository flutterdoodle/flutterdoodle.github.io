  - title: Story Cookbook
    description: The Story Cookbook was a children's book I worked on with <a href="http://storyplanet.ca/">Story Planet</a>, a non-profit devoted to literary programs for children. The book was intended to be a fun writing resource for children who wanted to create their own stories. My main task on this project as an illustrator was designing the book cover, and providing some of the illustrations for the interiors.
