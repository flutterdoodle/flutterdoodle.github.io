  <h1>Educational work</h1>
  <p>I care about childrenâ€™s education and growth, especially for girls and young people of color. One of my primary goals as an artist is to work with like-minded people to faciliate creativity and learning for kids and teens. Please feel free to reach out to me if you're interested in working together!</p>
  <p><code><em>"Janice is a reliable team player. Her commitment and hard-work in completing a high volume of illustrations within a short time frame is much appreciated. Janice's talent is showcased by her creativity and effectiveness in putting abstract expressions into visual form. I am very happy with the final illustrations and the collaborative processes by which they were produced."</em><br> - Dr. Fataneh Farnia, The Hincks-Dellcrest Centre</code></p>
