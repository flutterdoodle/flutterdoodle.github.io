<p>Janice Liu is a freelance illustrator, teaching artist, and kid-at-heart. She depicts playful worlds and characters, and her art is often inspired by the child-like tendency to make-believe. She's had a home in many cities: Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and most recently, Toronto. She now lives in the beautiful Vancouver area.</p>
