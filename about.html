Janice Liu is an illustrator, teaching artist, and kid-at-heart. She depicts sunny worlds and characters, and her art is often inspired by the child-like tendency to make-believe. She's had a home in many cities: Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and most recently, Toronto, where she attended the University of Toronto. She now lives in the beautiful Vancouver area.
