  <h1>Chicken Soup & Goji Berries 中药鸡汤</h1>
  <p>By Naomi Cui and Janice Liu</p> 
  <p>Published by Cloudscape Comics, ISBN 978-1-927742-13-6</p>
  <p>For the kids of the Yang family, who have spent most of their lives across the Pacific Ocean in Canada, Nainai’s arrival from China to move in with the family is a big change. From having to turn down the volume of their cartoons to being awakened by the soy milk machine at 7 AM, Jeannie, Ethan, and Cindy have much to get used to. But it’s not just the day-to-day routine that’s different now that Nainai is in their lives — there’s something different in the air, something <em>magical</em>.</p>
